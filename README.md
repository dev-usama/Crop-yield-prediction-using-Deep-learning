# Crop-yield-prediction-using-Deep-learning
In this project we used a multivariate time series dataset consisting of 20 crops. We trained three deep learning models Recurrent Neural Network, Gated Recurrent Unit, and Long Short Term Memory. GRU performed best between the three as it has fewer parameters than LSTM which causes overfitting and also solves the vanishing gradient problem of RNN.
